To start off:
1.Slice all your vegetables into thin slices.
2.Next , take 2 slices of bread and put a lot of butter on one of the sides of both the bread(butter side stays up). this will prevent it from becoming soggy.
3.Next, put lots of green chutney on the bread.
4.Next layer all your vegetables in any order you like.
5.Next, put cheese over all the vegetables.(any cheese will do, I am using mozeralla shredded cheese)
6.Put 2 slices of bread over all this. then add butter to the tops of the breads.
7.Put it in the griller. Once out, slice diagonally and serve.
